title: Develop chaincode locally
---


Developing the chaincode locally has the following benefits; for example you can:

- Develop the chaincode locally and test it locally.
- Debug the chaincode locally.
- Improve the installation time by 90% since peers don't need to install and start the chaincode for every change.
