In order to trigger the renewal of the certificates, either for the orderer or for the peer, we can use the `hlf ca renew <node_type>` command.

## Renewing certificates for the peer

```bash
PEER_NAME=org1-peer0
PEER_NS=default
kubectl hlf peer renew --name=$PEER_NAME --namespace=$PEER_NS
```

## Renewing certificates for the orderer

```bash
ORDERER_NAME=ord-node1
ORDERER_NS=default
kubectl hlf ordnode renew --name=$ORDERER_NAME --namespace=$ORDERER_NS
```
### !!!! IMPORTANT !!!!
When renewing the orderer certificates, the channel which the orderer is consenter of must be updated with the new certificates generated by the operator.

This operation is not handled by the operator, since the operator does not know the channels that the orderer is consenter of, neither has the authority to update the channel since the signatures needed can vary depending on the configuration.


## Renewing certificates for the consenter
```bash
```
